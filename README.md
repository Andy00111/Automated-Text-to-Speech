# Automated-Text-to-Speech
Here's a detailed guide on how to use the Text-to-Speech application:

1. **Starting the Application**
   - After launching the application, you'll see a window with several controls

2. **Main Interface Elements**
   - Title at the top: "Text to Speech Converter"
   - Voice selection dropdown: Choose from available system voices
   - Speech rate dropdown: Choose between Slow, Normal, or Fast
   - Large text input area in the middle
   - Three buttons at the bottom:
     * Convert to Speech
     * Export Audio
     * Clear Text

3. **Step-by-Step Usage Guide**

   a) **Entering Text**
   - Click in the large text area
   - Type or paste the text you want to convert to speech
   - You can enter multiple paragraphs if needed

   b) **Customizing Voice Settings**
   - From the "Select Voice" dropdown, choose your preferred voice
   - From the "Speech Rate" dropdown, select your preferred speed:
     * Slow: For slower, clearer speech
     * Normal: Default speed
     * Fast: For accelerated speech

   c) **Converting Text to Speech**
   - After entering your text, click the "Convert to Speech" button
   - Wait for the status message to show "Conversion complete!"
   - The "Export Audio" button will become enabled once conversion is done

   d) **Saving the Audio File**
   - Click the "Export Audio" button
   - A file save dialog will appear
   - Choose where you want to save the WAV file
   - Give your file a name (it will automatically add .wav extension)
   - Click Save
   - The status message will confirm the save location

   e) **Starting Over**
   - Click "Clear Text" to remove all text and start fresh
   - This will also reset the audio conversion

4. **Tips and Best Practices**
   - Test different voices to find the one you prefer
   - For long texts, break them into smaller paragraphs for better clarity
   - Save your audio files with descriptive names
   - The WAV format is widely compatible with most media players

5. **Common Issues and Solutions**
   - If no voices appear in the dropdown, ensure your system has TTS voices installed
   - If the conversion seems slow, try with smaller portions of text
   - If the audio isn't clear, try a slower speech rate
   - If you can't save the file, check your folder permissions

6. **Closing the Application**
   - Simply click the X button in the window corner
   - Any temporary files will be automatically cleaned up

Remember that the quality of the speech output depends on:
- The TTS voices installed on your system
- The complexity and length of the input text
- The selected voice and speech rate
